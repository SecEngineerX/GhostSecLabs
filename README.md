# 👾 GhostSec Labs

⚔️ **Security never sleeps. Neither do I.**

Welcome to my **Security Lab Portfolio** — where I break down, build up, and showcase projects that prove my skills in:

- **SOC Analysis (Blue Team)** → log analysis, SIEM labs, detection engineering  
- **Cloud Security (AWS)** → securing cloud infra, IAM, automation  
- **Offensive Security (OSCP Path)** → real-world exploitation, scripting, red team tactics  

---

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here
- 🛡️ **SOC Labs** → SIEM rules, log parsing, threat hunts  
- ☁️ **AWS Security Projects** → securing S3, IAM, VPC, detection automation  
- 🎯 **Red Team Tools** → small but deadly scripts & automation  
- 📄 **Writeups** → clear, recruiter-friendly documentation of labs  

---

## 🧪 Featured Projects
- **SOC-Playbook** → Hands-on incident response workflows  
- **CloudGuard-AWS** → scripts + configs for hardening AWS  
- **Pentest-Automator** → bash/python tools for recon + exploitation  
- **Detection-Labs** → simulated attacks & detections  

*(Each project is designed to be portfolio-ready: clear docs, code, impact.)*

---

## 📊 Current Focus
1. **SOC Analyst Path** → mastering SIEMs, log parsing, alert tuning  
2. **AWS Security** → building + breaking cloud infra, then securing it  
3. **OSCP Journey** → documenting each step with real labs

## 🧠 Philosophy
> **“Knowledge that doesn’t create tools, labs, or impact is wasted.”**  

This isn’t a sandbox. It’s a **public lab notebook** documenting my growth into a world-class cybersecurity engineer.
